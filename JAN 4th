Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

Solution:

from collections import Counter
from typing import List
from math import ceil

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Count the occurrences of each number in the input list
        counter = Counter(nums)
        
        # Initialize the variable to store the total operations required
        ans = 0
        
        # Iterate through the count of each unique number
        for c in counter.values():
            # If a number appears only once, it's not possible to form triplets
            if c == 1: 
                return -1
            
            # Calculate the minimum operations required to form triplets for the current number
            ans += ceil(c / 3)
        
        # Return the total operations required
        return ans
