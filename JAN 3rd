Solution:

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfBeams(self, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        # Initialize old count of '1's in the previous row to 0
        old = 0
        # Initialize the total number of laser beams to 0
        ans = 0
        
        # Iterate through each row in the bank
        for i in bank:
            # Count the number of '1's in the current row
            new = i.count('1')
            
            # If there are security devices in the current row
            if new != 0:
                # Update the total number of laser beams by adding the product of old and new
                ans += old * new
                # Update the old count to the current row's count of '1's
                old = new
        
        # Return the total number of laser beams
        return ans
